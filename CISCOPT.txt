en

# Enter global configuration mode
configure terminal
conf t

# Display the current running configuration
show running-config
sh run

# Display information about all interfaces
show interfaces
sh int

### Interface Configuration:
# Enter interface configuration mode
interface [interface_type] [interface_number]

# Configure an IP address on an interface
ip address [ip_address] [subnet_mask]
ip addr [ip_address] [subnet_mask]

# Add a description to the interface
description [description]
desc [description]

# Activate (enable) an interface
no shutdown
no shut

# Deactivate (disable) an interface
shutdown
shut

### Routing Configuration:
# Configure a static route
ip route [destination_network] [subnet_mask] [next_hop]

# Enter RIP routing configuration mode
router rip

# Specify a network for RIP routing
network [network_address]
net [network_address]

# Save and Load Configurations:
# Save the running configuration to the startup configuration
copy running-config startup-config
copy run start

# Load the startup configuration into the running configuration
copy startup-config running-config
copy start run

### Security:
# Set the enable secret (encrypted) password
enable secret [password]

# Create a local user and set the password
username [username] password [password]
username [username] pass [password]

# Enter VTY line configuration mode for SSH/TELNET access
line vty 0 4

# Require local authentication for VTY access
login local

### VLAN Configuration:
# Create a VLAN
vlan [vlan_id]

# Assign a name to a VLAN
name [vlan_name]

# Interface Configuration for VLAN:
# Set an interface to access mode (for connecting to a single VLAN)
switchport mode access

# Assign an access VLAN to an interface
switchport access vlan [vlan_id]

### NAT Configuration (on a router):
# Enter interface configuration mode for the external interface
interface [interface_type] [interface_number]

# Mark the interface as an outside NAT interface
ip nat outside

# Enter interface configuration mode for the internal interface
interface [interface_type] [interface_number]

# Mark the interface as an inside NAT interface
ip nat inside

# Configure a static NAT mapping
ip nat inside source static [internal_ip] [external_ip]

### Access Control Lists (ACLs):
# Create an ACL entry to permit traffic
access-list [number] permit [source] [wildcard]

# Create an ACL entry to deny traffic
access-list [number] deny [source] [wildcard]

# Create an ACL entry to permit or deny all traffic
access-list [number] [permit/deny] any

# Apply an ACL to an interface (inbound or outbound)
ip access-group [number] [in/out]

### LAN Configuration:
# Configure a DHCP relay agent to forward DHCP requests to a DHCP server
ip helper-address [dhcp_server_ip]

# Enter DHCP pool configuration mode to configure DHCP settings
ip dhcp pool [pool_name]

# Specify the DHCP address range for a pool
network [network_address] [subnet_mask]

### LAN Troubleshooting:
# Send ICMP echo requests to a destination IP address to test connectivity
ping [destination_ip]

# Trace the path to a destination IP address, showing each hop along the way
traceroute [destination_ip]

# Display the MAC address table to view MAC-to-port mappings on a switch
show mac address-table

# Show information about directly connected Cisco devices using CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol)
show cdp neighbors

# Display information about VLANs configured on a switch
show vlan

# View the DHCP bindings to see which devices have been assigned IP addresses
show ip dhcp binding
